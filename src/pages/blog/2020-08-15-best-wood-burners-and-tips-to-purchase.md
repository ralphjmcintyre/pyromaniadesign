Alright so which one should you buy?  When I first started wood burning I purchased the Walnut Hollow Versa Tool at Michaels for $34.99. This tool is great for the basics.  Want to make a sign? This tool is great.  Want to do a detailed landscape piece?... buy a more expensive burner.  The main reason is because the grip is wide, making it more difficult to maneuver fine details. 

There are exceptions to what I just said. I have seen beautiful, intricate work done with the Walnut Hollow tool... by very *naturally talented* artists.. so take that as you will.  

I am currently using the Colwood Detailer kit, and have no complaints!
